This project aims to develop a system for accurately recognizing facial expressions from images or video. The project leverages machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify seven facial expressions: angry, happy, fear, surprise, disgust, sad, and neutral. It utilizes the FER-2013 dataset, which contains approximately 35,000 images. These images are preprocessed and normalized to improve model accuracy. 

This project explores different models, including LeNet, ResNet, and VGG, finding that CNNs deliver the most consistent performance. A real-time demo application is also created using OpenCV, allowing users to predict facial expressions via a webcam feed. This project demonstrates skills in deep learning, image processing, and real-time application development, with potential applications in customer service, security, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.

To run this project, you need to:
- Dowload the dataset from Kaggle.
- Dowload CNN model and haarcascade classifier.
- Set up the environment.
- Run file main.py and see the result.
